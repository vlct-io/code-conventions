# Copyright

As a open source project, there must be a LICENSE file to claim the rights. 

Here are two examples of using [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and MIT licenses.

### Apache License, Version 2.0

This license requires to put following content at the beginning of every file:

```
// Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]
//
// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"): you may
// not use this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain
// a copy of the License at
//
//     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
//
// Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software
// distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
// WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the
// License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations
// under the License.
```

Replace `[yyyy]` with the year of creation of the file. Then use personal name for personal project, or organization name for team project to replace `[name of copyright owner]`.

### MIT License

This license requires to put following content at the beginning of every file:

```
// Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]. All rights reserved.
// Use of this source code is governed by a MIT-style
// license that can be found in the LICENSE file.
```

Replace `[yyyy]` with the year of creation of the file.

### Other Notes

- Other types of license can follow the template of above two examples.
- If a file has been modified by different individuals/organizations, and two licenses are compatiable, then change the first line to multiple lines and make them in the order of time:

	```
	// Copyright 2011 Gary Burd
	// Copyright 2013 Unknwon
	```
	
- Spefify which license is used for the project in the README file:

	```
	## License
